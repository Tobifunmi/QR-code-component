## My process

- I created the background that filled the whole screen
- Then, a div having a class of box
- Fixed the image into the div
- Made the text into headers 4 & 5
- Styled everything in CSS

### Built with

- HTML5 
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  display:block
} - I've not gotten the hang of the differences between the display properties
```

### Continued development

I didn't know how to fit the whole div into the center of the page

### Useful resources
